# LeagueClient

This project is based off an application I built in May 2022 that webscraped data from two different websites, OP.GG and U.GG.

The previous version of this project was converted from Windows Forms to ASP.NET Razor Pages.

My main goal for this project is to completely redesign it using C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server, and JavaScript. Instead of webscraping data, the motivation behind redesigning this is to utilize Riot API to access the desired data more effectively and to eliminate the previous problem I ran into with HTML Nodes changing on the various websites I was scraping.
