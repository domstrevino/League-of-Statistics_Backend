# LeagueClient

This project is based off an application I built in May 2022 that webscraped data from two different websites, OP.GG and U.GG.

My project was converted to ASP.NET Razor Pages but has since been lost due to the computer it was on being completely wiped in June.

My main goal for this project is to completely redesign it using C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server, and JavaScript. Instead of webscraping data, the motivation behind redesigning this is to utilize Riot API to access the desired data more effectively and to eliminate the previous problem I ran into with HTML Nodes changing on the various websites I was scraping.
